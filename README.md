# sqlite-personal-dictionary
I believe Korean language is similar to my native Burmese Language in many ways. One similarity is that the composition of each vocabulary is made up of base syllable which has their own meaning. So, this project is born out of desparate need when my intp brain can't memorize vocabulary without breaking them down into base syllable components. 

I tried to find other projects which could full-fill my need. I thought stardict and goldendict could do it since they are dictionary software. But those dictionary app lack updating new vocabulary frequently. I was lazy and skeptical at first since I don't have much time. I had to study but a simple database and python simple database. That's all I need. I asked chatgpt for most of the code. I tweaked the code into my work flow. Now, this project satisfies me. 

You can use also use this program as your personal dictionary. The functionality is pretty straight forward. Vocabulary building is much better in Anki but as I said I used this program for my intp brain.
